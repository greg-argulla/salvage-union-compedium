It provides the Pilot and their companion with a regular supply of (illegal) fresh fruit and vegetables. \n\n*Corrupted Neuralink Module*\n `T5` | üî∫ - 1  |‚öôÔ∏è - 2\nThis thin array of harmless looking mesh is effectively identical to neuralinks found in certain Mechs that allow for one-to-one Pilot to Mech interfacing. It happens to be one of the most grievous torture devices ever invented and it does not leave a mark.

An organic target hit suffers an agonizing death from acute radiation poisoning. They will suffer a Major Injury every day which reduces their Max HP by 2 each time.\n\nThis attack can target Pilots inside their Mechs, unless they have Radiation Sealing or equivalent.\n\n*Black Market Pilot Equipment:*\n\n*Blinding Blue Laser Rifle*\n` T3//Range: Close//Damage: 3 HP//Energy`\nThis portable laser rifle is designed to permanently blind targets shot by it. A creature hit by \nthis weapon suffers the Minor Injury of temporary blindness in addition to the normal damage it inflicts.
