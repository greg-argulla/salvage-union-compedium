Explain what this means\n\nYou are now friendly with this NPC and can ask them for three of the following favours. You \nmay choose the same option multiple times.\n\n• Restore up to 4 SP on a single Mech or Vehicle with at least 1 SP.\n• Answer any question about the local area, Mechs, and mechanical & engineering topics.\n • Repair a single damaged System or Module to Intact Condition. This must be of a Tech Level \nthe wastelander could reasonably repair as decided by the Mediator. \n• Provide food, shelter, and lodgings for you and the other salvagers in your crew.\n• Provide a favour within their power and ability to grant as adjudicated by the Mediator.\n\nIf you meet that same person again you may repeat the phrase and they will offer you a single favour.\n\nYou may deploy your Auto-Turret in a location you are in as a Turn Action\n\nYour Auto-Turret has a unique personality. Choose this or roll on the A.I. Personality Table \np. 91. Name your Auto-Turret if you want to get especially attached.\n\nYour Auto-Turret has a Tech Level equal to your Union Crawler. Your Auto-Turret is upgraded \nalong with your Union Crawler, it gains additional stats as shown for each Tech level above the first.

Name any Mech Chassis, System, or Module \nof a Tech Level less than, equal to, or one level higher than the settlement you are in. The Mediator\ndecides the Tech Level of the settlement.
