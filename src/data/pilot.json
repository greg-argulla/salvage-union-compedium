If the vehicle is accessible when the conflict begins, characters may enter it `immediately` (during step 2 on page 59 of the Core Rulebook).\n\n- `Leaving` the vehicle doesn't require an action, but during a conflict it can only be done on your turn, `before or after` an action.\n\n- The vehicle can hold a variable number of human-sized creatures depending on its `frame` and `modules`, but `only its Pilot may drive it`. Additionally, the other passengers `cannot cover creatures` when they perform the `Guard` action.\n\n- The `maximum number of modules active at the same time` on the vehicle is equal to`【3 + its Pilot's Skill Level in Personal Vehicle】`. The Pilot may freely reassign their vehicle's active and inactive modules outside conflicts.\n\nThe standard frames and modules are listed in the upcoming pages. Note that whenever a module's text mentions 'you', it is referring to the Pilot that the module's vehicle belongs to.\n\n`Example`: you might create an armored motorbike by combining the `Steed` frame with the `Heavy Plating` and `Turbo modules`; or create a flying combat armor by combining an `Exoskeleton` frame with the `Aerial`, `Runic Plating`, `Rifle` and `Sword modules`."

Note that a Pilot can still equip these modules `even if they normally lack the ability` to equip martial armors.\n\nFor instance, a Pilot with the `Guardian` Class can gain the benefits of `Defensive Mastery` while driving a vehicle with an active `Heavy Plating module`; at the same time, that Pilot would not be able to benefit from the `Rogue`'s `Dodge` Skill"
