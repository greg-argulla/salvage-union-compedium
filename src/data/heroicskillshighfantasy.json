You also do not gain any of the `merge` benefits you would normally enjoy when summoning that Arcanum. The summoned creature has the following profile:\n\n- `Level` is equal to your level (thus gaining the bonuses to Checks and damage listed under steps `8` on page `303` of the Core Rulebook).\n\n- A `d10` in one Attribute of your choice, and a `d8` in all other Attributes.\n\n- `Maximum Hit Points` equal to`【twice the creature’s base Might die size, plus half of your maximum Hit Points】`. The creature has no `Mind Points`.\n\n- Resistance to `two` damage types of your choice.\n\n- The creature receives all the `merge` benefits the Arcanum would normally grant you when summoned (damage Affinities, immunity to status effects, increased Attribute sizes, etc.). If a `merge` benefit would cause the Arcanum to be dismissed, this will cause the summoned creature to vanish unless you spend 20 Mind Points.\n\n- A `melee basic attack` whose Accuracy Check relies on `two different Attributes` of your choice and deals`【HR + 8】physical` damage. Choose `two different options`: the attack is a `ranged` attack; `or` it deals 4 extra damage; `or` it deals damage of a type other than `physical`; `or` the Accuracy Check relies on a `single Attribute`.\n\n- The creature may perform the Skill action to produce one of the `dismiss` effects normally granted by that Arcanum, but doing so will cause the summoned creature to vanish unless you spend 20 Mind Points.\n\n- The summoned Arcanum also obtains the `pulse` benefits in your stead, and can use the Skill action to perform said `pulse`.\n\n- `Grand Summoning` can only be used when an Arcanum is summoned `without Quick Summoning`.\n\nThe following rules apply when you `Grand Summon` an Arcanum:\n\n- The creature is always summoned at full Hit Points, with no status effects.\n\n - The creature vanishes if it reaches 0 Hit Points, if you die, lose consciousness or leave the scene, or `if you summon or Grand Summon`  an Arcanum again. The creature also vanishes when a scene ends, or if you simply command them to do so (this will `not` trigger the corresponding Arcanum’s dismiss effect).\n\n- Take note of all choices made for `Attributes` and `basic attack` during the first time `Summon` a given Arcanum: these choices will remain unchanged whenever you `Grand Summon` that same Arcanum again in the future."
