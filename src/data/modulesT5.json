You may activate each separately.\n\n*3EP Pinpoint Targeter p. 196*\n`Turn Action // Targeter`\nMake an attack at a selected target. If it hits select a system or appendage to be damaged/injured. If you roll a 20 it is destroyed instead. You also deal damage as normal.\n\n*XEP Multi-Targeter p. 200*\n`Turn Action // Targeter`\nMake an attack with any number of weapons. Each weapon must select a different target. Costs 1 EP per weapon fired.\n\n*3EP Laser Guidance p. 204*\n`Free Action // Range: Long // Targeter`\nThe next attack you make against that target automatically hits counting as an (11-19) result."

      "detail": "`T5` 🔺 - 1 ⚙️ - 2\n\nDeveloped by Ascension PLC as a means for their corporate minds to communicate with the material realm, this holo projector uses a complex laser array to project solid, life-like, three dimensional holograms into the world.\n\nWhen activated, this Module projects a lifelike, three dimensional, hologram into an area within Range. The hologram appears to onlookers as though it was realistic and can be viewed from multiple angles. It can be spoken through or set to repeat a message, make animal calls, or mimic the sounds of explosions or weapons firing. The hologram can have any appearance that you choose and can be either Mech or Pilot-sized. The hologram stays in place within the location you set for 24 hours."

In addition, you may choose what the output of your brain frequencies sounds like, altering the pitch and tone to your liking. This works as a Voice Modulator p. 202. These communications are also encrypted, working as an Encrypted Comms p. 200. The Neuralink Communicator may also be detached and used by your Pilot in the field as a Portable Communications Unit p. 81. "
