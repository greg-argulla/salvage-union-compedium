Onlookers are highly impressed. It is not quite teleporting through walls, but trust me this, it is incredibly complicated to program a Mech to do."

The tech blueprints were stolen by a hacker known as Case, and are now in the arsenal of the most powerful Union Crawlers in the wastes.\n\nWhen activated, your Mech becomes phased. Whilst in a phased state your Mech can move through walls, objects, structures, and other Mechs. Your Mech is visible, but only by a faint glowing outline. You cannot attack or otherwise interact with anything whilst phased. You can unphase as a Free Action at no cost. "

This Reaction always resolves first. After this has resolved, increase your Mech’s Heat by 2 and make a Heat Check."

This allows your Mech to activate Energy Point Abilities by increasing its Heat by 2× that amount instead. For example: you could activate a 2 EP Ability by instead increasing your Mech’s Heat by 4.\n\nAnytime you would increase your Mech’s Heat you may instead decrease your Mech’s Energy Points by that amount. For example: if you attacked with a Hot (2) weapon you could spend 2 EP instead of increasing your Mech’s Heat by 2."
