When entering an area you are able to get an up to date report on the weather of that area and any potential hazardous environmental conditions. In addition, the Module alerts you when a shift in weather patterns is occurring, giving you advance warning of severe weather such as radiation storms, acid rain, hail, hurricanes, and tornadoes. You also learn all potential negative effects of the current and predicted weather conditions, including mechanical effects."

This can be a specific terrain feature or location such as a mountain range, military complex, settlement, or area in the landscape. If a point is not worth scanning because it holds nothing of interest, the Mediator must tell you before you make your scan. \n\nThe scan returns a basic datamap of the underground area, including its size as well as the first three main sections as well as any passageways between those sections. The Mediator will draw you a rudimentary map noting any major features such as bridges, columns, or crevasses, and lets you know if the area can fit Mechs or Pilots."
