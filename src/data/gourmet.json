You roll a `1` and `5` for their tastes, which means one tastes `bitter` and the other tastes `umami`.\nYou decide to call the first `ingredient` 'Fossil Honey' and the second `ingredient` 'Stonebark Shroom'.

Once you're done, record the resulting effect on your `cookbook sheet`: from this moment on, that `combination` of tastes will `always` produce that exact `effect` when you use it.\n\n- No two combinations of tastes in your `cookbook sheet` can have `identical effects`.\n\n- When you determine the effect of a new combination, you must make your choices in such a way that the resulting effect has no precedents (for instance, by selecting a different damage type or status effect); if you can't, `reroll the d12`./n/n- When completed, your `cookbook sheet` will feature a total of `15 effects`, one for each possible pair of tastes.\n\n`Example`: you combine three ingredients, one of them `salty` and two of them `bitter`. The resulting `delicacy` features two combinations (`bitter + bitter` and `bitter + salty`), which means it will have two different effects.\nIn the past, you combined `bitter + bitter` and rolled a 4, which means the effect allows for MP recovery; on the other hand, you never combined `bitter + salty` before, so you need to determine this combination's effect by rolling dice.\nYou roll a `1`, and must choose a status effect for this effect; since you already chose recovery from `weak` for the `sour + sweet` combination in the past, you decide to opt for `dazed`. From now on, the `bitter + salty` combination will always allow you to heal the target from `dazed`.\nNow that you've done this, you know that your `delicacy` allows every target to heal from the `dazed` status effect and also recover 40 Mind Points.\n\n`Delicacies` created through the `Cooking` Skill have an immediate effect and are then destroyed; if you want to prepare foods with unique effects and use them later, you must instead use the rules for `Projects`."

Other than that, pay attention to which effects best synergize with each other and with the rest of your group, and take advantage of the `multi` property to apply the same `delicacy` to two or more enemies!"
