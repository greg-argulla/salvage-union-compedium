Add this to your Pilot Equipment.\n\nThis handheld device when triggered causes a localized electromagnetic pulse that can disable a wide range of electronic equipment.\n\nWhen you activate the Miniaturized EMP all Mechs, Systems, Modules, and any other electronic or technological equipment or hardware within Close Range are Shutdown and inoperable for 10 minutes. This Ability affects Meld, causing them to become inert for 10 minutes and be unable to act. This Ability does not affect Bio-Titans unless they are significantly made up of material that an electromagnetic pulse can affect. If your Miniaturized EMP is misplaced or destroyed, you can acquire a new one during Downtime. You may only ever have one Miniaturized EMP at a time."

      "detail": "`Downtime Action`\nYour intense study and fascination with the core design of Mechs in their multiple forms allows you to modify a Mech Chassis to gain an array of abilities it was not initially designed for.\n\nOnce during Downtime you can modify your Mech Chassis. It gains any Chassis Ability of your choice from any Mech that you could craft in your Crafting Bay. For example, if you have a Tech 4 Crafting Bay you can modify the Mech with any Chassis Ability from any Tech 1-4 Mech. You may only have one additional Chassis Ability on a Mech, though you can replace one that you have added during Downtime. You can only use this Ability on your Mech, and it only works when you are piloting the Mech"

Your talents at fabrication allow you to take even the bulkiest of Mech technology and scale it down to a portable size. \n\nOnce during Downtime, at a Crafting Bay, you can convert any System you own into a miniaturized version of that System. The System now takes up half as many System Slots when mounted on your Mech, to a minimum of 1. In addition, the System is small and portable enough for you to wield and use it as though it was Pilot Equipment. It takes up 3 Inventory Slots. If it has any EP costs, you may spend AP to use them.\n\nOnly you can wield the System as Pilot Equipment, and only you can mount and use it on a Mech you control. The System does not work when anyone else pilots the Mech."

This allows you to control the Mech remotely as a drone, removing the need of a fleshy pilot.\n\nYou may use this Ability once during Downtime to convert a single Mech you own into a Droned Mech. This Mech does not require a Pilot and cannot be piloted normally. Instead it is controlled by you via a special controller you possess as Pilot Equipment. \n\nIt can be controlled from up to Far Range. If the Mech has Radomes installed it can be controlled from anywhere within the Area Map you are in, including your Union Crawler.\n\nControlling a Mech this way takes up all of your concentration, as though you were piloting it, and you cannot do anything else whilst controlling it except speak and occasionally sip from a beverage.
