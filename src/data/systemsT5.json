An effective siege weapon due to having time between attacks to cool down the Mech, these were deployed in the First Corpo War by Evantis to obliterate the Last Redoubt of Nations and pave the way for corpo rule.\n\nBefore you make an attack with this Weapons System, choose a number. Your Mech gains Heat equal to this number. If the attack hits the target it deals damage equal to this number. For example: if you increase your Heat by 3, the attack deals 3 SP damage.
