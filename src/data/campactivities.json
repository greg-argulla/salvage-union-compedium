They decide to play a resting scene inside the tavern; Brandon `sleeps soundly` to gain an additional action in the future, while Martha prepares a `double portion` for Ylua, who is often the target of the party's healing spells. Seeing Martha's kindness, Ylua decides to use this scene to `gather` a few useful ingredients for the cook... hoping not to get into any trouble!\n\nWhether they perform a Camp Activity or not, characters may still use the resting scene to adjust their `Bonds`."
