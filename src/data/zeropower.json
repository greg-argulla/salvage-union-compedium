You may only do so `once per turn`.\n\n- Unleashing the `zero effect` erases all sections of the Zero Clock.\n\n- All sections of the Zero Clock are automatically erased at the end of each scene.\n\n- Sections of the Zero Clock may `not` be filled nor erased in any way except as indicated above, or through the `Zero Chance` effect."
